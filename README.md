## ThermoBuzzer, a thermosense to prevent overheated stoves

Place it near the stoves. 

Once the temperature continuously reaches 50 degrees (able to modify using a constant), ThermoBuzzer will beep continuously every five minutes until the button is clicked to ensure someone is there.

Once the temperature reaches 70 degrees (able to modify using a constant), ThermoBuzzer will beep continuously right away until the button is clicked.
